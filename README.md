## Swagger API Documentation

This project includes Swagger for API documentation. After starting the server,
you can access Swagger UI at:

Local: http://localhost:3001/api-docs

Production (Render): https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com/api-docs ‚úî

Server (Render): https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com üåç

All endpoints are described in `swagger.json`, covering **User, Points,
Routes,** and more. You can test requests directly in the browser using the ‚ÄúTry
it out‚Äù button, but note that you must provide a valid **Bearer token** for
protected routes.

**Important**: If you‚Äôre dealing with very large data (e.g. tens of thousands of
coordinates), Swagger UI may lag while rendering the JSON response. In such
cases, Postman or cURL might be more responsive for heavy payloads.

## Overview

This repository hosts the backend for the **VueMap-Explorer** application. It
provides essential API endpoints and services to support the frontend and manage
data through MongoDB Atlas. The backend also supports GeoJSON for handling
geographical data, enabling advanced mapping and geospatial functionalities.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages a diverse set of technologies and libraries to ensure a
robust and scalable backend:

- **Node.js** ‚Äì JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express** ‚Äì Web framework for building APIs.
- **MongoDB Atlas** ‚Äì Cloud-based NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose** ‚Äì ODM library for MongoDB.
- **Swagger** ‚Äì For API documentation (using `swagger-ui-express` and
  `swagger-jsdoc`).
- **GeoJSON** ‚Äì Standard format for encoding geographic data.
- **dotenv** ‚Äì Environment variable management.
- **cors** ‚Äì Handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **morgan** ‚Äì HTTP request logging.
- **cookie-parser** ‚Äì Parsing cookies.
- **axios** ‚Äì Promise-based HTTP client.
- **bcryptjs** ‚Äì Password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken** ‚Äì Authentication token management.
- **joi** ‚Äì Data validation.
- **moment** ‚Äì Date formatting and manipulation.
- **multer & multer-storage-cloudinary** ‚Äì File uploads and cloud storage
  integration.
- **nanoid & uuid** ‚Äì Unique identifier generation.
- **nodemailer & @sendgrid/mail** ‚Äì Email sending services.
- **cloudinary** ‚Äì Cloud-based media management.
- **Additional utilities:** Libraries like `jimp` for image processing and
  `query-string` for query string manipulation.

This comprehensive stack is inspired by the technology set in the reference
repository and is tailored to meet the specific needs of the VueMap-Explorer
project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxexc/backend-vue-map-explorer.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Create .env file (see Environment Variables below for required keys)**

4. **Run the Development Server:**

```bash
   npm run dev
```

By default it will run on http://localhost:3001.

5. **(Optional) Build Production Version:**

```bash
   npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

You‚Äôll need a .env file with (for example):

```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
   JWT_SECRET=some_really_secret_key
   EXPIRES_TIME=1h
   CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://...
   PORT=3001
```

Adjust according to your own environment.
